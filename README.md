# Coding Together!

A small diff-editor using in local-network.

## Intro

This program will host the server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

## Warning

CodT is now under developing. It may contain some bugs and not work properly.

**Known bugs:**

+ You cannot stop and restart the server when users are still using the your CodT service.

## Install

### Recommend: Download From Release

**For Windows users**, double-click the `exe` file will automatically open a terminal just like other terminal-based programs. You can stop the server by just closing the terminal window.

~~**For Macos users**, we don't really know what will happen because water\_lift has no money to buy a MacBook~~
